# Pizza Designer!

The pizza designer form is in need of user interface enhancements!

## Installation

Run `npm install`

## Usage

To run the live server, run `npm run serve`

## Tasks

1. Make it so that the button is in the **hovered** state, it has the CSS property `background-color: red`.

2. Make it so that the button is in the **active** state (state of being clicked), it has the CSS property `background-color: orangered`.

3. Peppers are no longer available!

The peppers option is not available, so it has been disabled with the "disabled" attribute, but it still looks like it can be clicked. To give the user some feedback, make it so that input fields which are **disabled** have a property of `display: none;`.

4. Make it so when only the **number** and **text** input fields are in the **focus** state, they have the property `border: 5px solid violet`.

Hint: You will need to use a combination of psuedo-class selectors and attribute selectors!
